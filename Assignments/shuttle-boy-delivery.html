        // You're a Shuttle food delivery driver somewhere in Seoul, near your first assignment. "Near", unfortunately, is as close as you can get - the instructions on the Shuttle Delivery Document the start here, and nobody had time to work them out further.

        // The Document indicates that you should start at the given coordinates (where you are now) and face North. Then, follow the provided sequence: either turn left (L) or right (R) 90 degrees, then walk forward the given number of blocks, ending at a new intersection.

        // There's no time to follow such ridiculous instructions, though, so you take a moment and work out the destination. Given that you can only drive on the street grid of the city, how far is the shortest path to the destination?

        // For example:

        // Following R2, L3 leaves you 2 blocks East and 3 blocks North, or 5 blocks away.
        // R2, R2, R2 leaves you 2 blocks due South of your starting position, which is 2 blocks away.
        // R5, L5, R5, R3 leaves you 12 blocks away.

        // How many blocks away is your first assignment?


        // BONUS: Then, you notice the instructions continue on the back of the Document. Your first assignment is actually at the first location you visit twice.

        // For example, if your instructions are R8, R4, R4, R8, the first location you visit twice is 4 blocks away, due East.

        // How many blocks away is the first location you visit twice?


        // Your Document looks like this:
