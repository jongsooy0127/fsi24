// You're a Shuttle food delivery driver somewhere in Seoul, near your first assignment. "Near", unfortunately, is as close as you can get - the instructions on the Shuttle Delivery Document the start here, and nobody had time to work them out further.

// The Document indicates that you should start at the given coordinates (where you are now) and face North. Then, follow the provided sequence: either turn left (L) or right (R) 90 degrees, then walk forward the given number of blocks, ending at a new intersection.

// There's no time to follow such ridiculous instructions, though, so you take a moment and work out the destination. Given that you can only drive on the street grid of the city, how far is the shortest path to the destination?

// For example:

// Following R2, L3 leaves you 2 blocks East and 3 blocks North, or 5 blocks away.
// R2, R2, R2 leaves you 2 blocks due South of your starting position, which is 2 blocks away.
// R5, L5, R5, R3 leaves you 12 blocks away.

// How many blocks away is your first assignment?


// BONUS: Then, you notice the instructions continue on the back of the Document. Your first assignment is actually at the first location you visit twice.

// For example, if your instructions are R8, R4, R4, R8, the first location you visit twice is 4 blocks away, due East.

// How many blocks away is the first location you visit twice?


// Your Document looks like this:

R3, L5, R2, L1, L2, R5, L2, R2, L2, L2, L1, R2, L2, R4, R4, R1, L2, L3, R3, L1, R2, L2, L4, R4, R5, L3, R3, L3, L3, R4, R5, L3, R3, L5, L1, L2, R2, L1, R3, R1, L1, R187, L1, R2, R47, L5, L1, L2, R4, R3, L3, R3, R4, R1, R3, L1, L4, L1, R2, L1, R4, R5, L1, R77, L5, L4, R3, L2, R4, R5, R5, L2, L2, R2, R5, L2, R194, R5, L2, R4, L5, L4, L2, R5, L3, L2, L5, R5, R2, L3, R3, R1, L4, R2, L1, R5, L1, R5, L1, L1, R3, L1, R5, R2, R5, R5, L4, L5, L5, L5, R3, L2, L5, L4, R3, R1, R1, R4, L2, L4, R5, R5, R4, L2, L2, R5, R5, L5, L2, R4, R4, L4, R1, L3, R1, L1, L1, L1, L4, R5, R4, L4, L4, R5, R3, L2, L2, R3, R1, R4, L3, R1, L4, R3, L3, L2, R2, R2, R2, L1, L4, R3, R2, R2, L3, R2, L3, L2, R4, L2, R3, L4, R5, R4, R1, R5, R3
