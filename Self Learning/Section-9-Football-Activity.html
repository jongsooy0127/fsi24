        //     Your tasks:
        // 1. Create one player array for each team(variables 'players1' and 
        // 'players2')

        // 2. The first player in any player array is the goalkeeper and the others are field
        // players.For Bayern Munich(team 1) create one variable('gk') with the 
        // goalkeeper's name, and one array ('fieldPlayers') with all the remaining 10 
        // field players

        // 3. Create an array 'allPlayers' containing all players of both teams(22 
        // players)

        // 4. During the game, Bayern Munich(team 1) used 3 substitute players.So create a
        // new array('players1Final') containing all the original team1 players plus
        // 'Thiago', 'Coutinho' and 'Perisic'

        // 5. Based on the game.odds object, create one variable for each odd(called 
        // 'team1', 'draw' and 'team2')

        // 6. Write a function ('printGoals') that receives an arbitrary number of player
        // names(not an array) and prints each of them to the console, along with the 
        // number of goals that were scored in total(number of player names passed in)

        // 7. The team with the lower odd is more likely to win.Print to the console which 
        // team is more likely to win, without using an if/else statement or the ternary 
        // operator
